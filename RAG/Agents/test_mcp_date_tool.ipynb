    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how the Needle and Summary agents use the MCP Date Difference tool for deterministic date calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why MCP Tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Why NOT Use LLM for Date Calculations:\n",
    "- LLMs **approximate** (\"about 25 days\")\n",
    "- LLMs **forget** leap years and month boundaries\n",
    "- LLMs **hallucinate** numbers\n",
    "- No guarantee of correctness\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Why Use MCP Tool:\n",
    "- **Exact** calculation (25 days, not \"about 25\")\n",
    "- **Deterministic** (same input = same output)\n",
    "- **Verifiable** (can check the math)\n",
    "- **Handles edge cases** (leap years, month boundaries)\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Query: \"How many days between Jon Mor's accident and repair?\"\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "Agent retrieves context:\n",
    "    \"Accident Date: 2024-01-24\n",
    "     Repair Appointment: 2024-02-18\"\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "LLM sees dates in context\n",
    "LLM recognizes: \"Need to calculate days!\"\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "LLM calls: calculate_days_between('2024-01-24', '2024-02-18')\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "MCP Tool returns: {\"number_of_days\": 25}\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "LLM formats: \"25 days passed between...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point:** The LLM decides when to use the tool. No Python conditionals!"

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Date Calculation (Needle Agent)**\n",
    "   - Query asks about time between dates\n",
    "   - LLM automatically calls MCP tool\n",
    "   - Returns exact number: **25 days**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Timeline Synthesis (Summary Agent)**\n",
    "   - Query asks for timeline with duration\n",
    "   - LLM calls MCP tool for calculation\n",
    "   - Integrates result into narrative\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regular Query (No Tools)**\n",
    "   - Simple fact extraction\n",
    "   - No tool call needed\n",
    "   - Works normally\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **LLM Decides** - No Python conditionals, LLM chooses when to use tools  \n",
    "✅ **Exact Results** - No \"approximately\" or \"about\"  \n",
    "✅ **Seamless** - Regular queries work exactly the same  \n",
    "✅ **Verifiable** - Can check the date arithmetic externally  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This is Better Than Prompting:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without MCP Tool:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "LLM: \"Approximately 24 or 25 days passed...\"\n",
    "     ❌ Imprecise\n",
    "     ❌ Might be wrong\n",
    "     ❌ Cannot verify\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With MCP Tool:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Tool: {\"number_of_days\": 25}\n",
    "LLM: \"Exactly 25 days passed...\"\n",
    "     ✅ Precise\n",
    "     ✅ Guaranteed correct\n",
    "     ✅ Verifiable\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ✅ Both agents support MCP tools\n",
    "2. ✅ LLM decides when to use them\n",
    "3. ✅ Backward compatible with existing queries\n",
    "4. 🚀 Ready for production use!\n",
    "\n",
    "To disable MCP tools:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "needle_agent = create_needle_agent(enable_mcp_tools=False)\n",
    "summary_agent = create_summary_agent(enable_mcp_tools=False)\n",
