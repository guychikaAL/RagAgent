The assigned adjuster for the case is Linda Cooper.\n\nThe vehicle involved in the accident is a 2015 Toyota Corolla, with the license plate PLT100 and VIN VINCODE123450000. The collision caused moderate deformation to the rear bumper. Weather conditions at the time included strong winds and heavy rain, which reduced visibility, as confirmed by a witness.\n\nRepair estimates for the damages are $500 and $600, with AutoFix Garage assigned for repairs. A repair appointment is scheduled for July 8, 2024. A mini timeline of events includes the initial collision at 14:59, details exchanged at 15:15, ambulance arrival at 15:33, and the vehicle being towed at 15:15.
